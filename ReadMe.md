Most of the codes are my brain child and completely based on type of coding question and hints available.
Although I've taken help from other websites, few online codes to get good solutions or an idea to find solution.

I can't really say every code is perfect, if you find anything missing leave comments or fix it on your own.

If you are reading this, that means you are solving similar questions which I solved previously or attempted to solve.
Also, if you've better solution than me then do you comment.
